						<h2>About Kicks4Kids</h2>
						<p><strong><span>Kicks4Kids</span></strong> could soon be in your school providing a <em>football</em> coaching service. Philip is an F.A. qualified coach and has taken children to the U.S.A. and Denmark for youth tournaments as well as having coached at senior level. In the past we have been involved with Enfield F.C, Enfield Town F.C., Royston Town and Bishop Stortford Football Clubs. During the past <strong>twelve years</strong> we have been active in teaching football on a daily basis in schools throughout Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire. We also run football weeks during all the school holidays.
